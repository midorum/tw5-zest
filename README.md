TiddlyWiki plugin for organizing personal quizzes

## Introduction

Zest is a plugin for [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) that transforms your wiki into a flexible quiz and knowledge management system. It enables you to organize information into domains (areas of knowledge), categories (topics within domains), and theses (statements or facts about categories). These pairs of category and thesis can be used for interval repetition and self-testing.

Zest is designed to help you prepare for various types of tests, exams, or learning sessions by structuring your knowledge and supporting spaced repetition. The plugin integrates with the [SRS plugin](https://github.com/midorum/tw5-srs) to schedule learning sessions and optimize retention.

## Use Cases

* **Exam Preparation:** Organize subjects into domains, break them down into categories, and add key facts or concepts as theses. Use quizzes to test your recall.
* **Language Learning:** Create domains for languages, categories for grammar topics or vocabulary groups, and theses for example sentences or rules.
* **Technical Interview Prep:** Structure domains for technologies, categories for concepts or algorithms, and theses for definitions or code snippets.
* **General Knowledge Management:** Build a personal wiki of facts, organizing them for easy review and interval repetition.

## Features

* Manage multiple domains (areas of knowledge)
* Add, rename, describe, and delete domains
* Create categories linked to one or more domains
* Add multiple theses to each category
* Edit and delete categories and theses
* Prevent orphaned categories and theses
